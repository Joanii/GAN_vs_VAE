# GAN vs. VAE
With this project the sample generating of GANs and VAEs can be compared. 
The models are examplary trained on the MNIST dataset.
Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the respective virtual environment.

To train the models run `python -m src.GAN` or `python -m src.VAE`.

To generate samples and create a plot to compare the two approaches run `python -m src.comparison`.
